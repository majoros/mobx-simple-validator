# MobX Simple Validator

## Overview

To spite there being so many form validation modules none of them really semed to work well for my use case. The criteria this module
sets out to satisfy are as follows. 

* Simple and light weight.
* As little boilerplate code as posible. 
* Works well with Mobx as well as MUI6 or basicly any react component library.

## Building the module

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Example 

To run the example run the following commands, after you ran the commands above to install and build the module...
```
cd example
npm install
npm start
```

You can then go to `http://localhost:3000` to view and test.
